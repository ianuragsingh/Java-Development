This is to compare this implementation with what I had worked in
module 5:

CityMarker class:

I kind of had the side idea as this regarding calculating width
but was not sure on how to calculate height.I dont like how he 
figured height it looks kind of hacky. But I guess it works.

EarthQuakeMarker class:
	
	selectMarkerIfHover: 
	  kind of similar implementation so not much different here
	
	mouseClicked:
	 we have taken a different approach . My approach is to reuse same code or overload the calss 
	 whereas the given implementations separates city marker from quake marker.
